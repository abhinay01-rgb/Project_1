# Enterprise Education Intelligence Platform  
## Multi-Agent AI System with Hybrid RAG, QA Gates, and Auditability

This project is a **production-grade multi-agent AI system** designed for the **education domain**, delivering **evidence-based academic analysis at scale**.  
It demonstrates **enterprise AI engineering practices**, including agent orchestration, advanced RAG pipelines, quality assurance validation, and cost-aware system design.

The architecture is inspired by **real-world Azure AI Foundry–based systems** and is implemented locally using **LangChain and LangGraph**, making it straightforward to migrate to **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, Azure AI Search, Azure Service Bus, and Azure SignalR**.
